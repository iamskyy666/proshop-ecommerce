Our MERN e-commerce project uses **react-router-dom v6.10.0**, We'll focus on **v6-style routing** rather than newer v7 features.

---

# What is React Router?

React is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** framework.

Without a router:

```text
example.com
```

always renders the same React app.

To display different pages:

```text
/
 /products
 /product/123
 /cart
 /login
```

React needs a routing system.

That's what **React Router DOM** provides.

It maps URLs to React components.

---

# Why do we need it?

Traditional websites:

```text
GET /
GET /about
GET /contact
```

The server returns a completely new HTML page each time.

---

React SPA:

```text
/
```

loads once.

After that:

```text
/about
/contact
```

are handled by JavaScript without reloading the browser.

This makes navigation:

* Faster
* Smoother
* More app-like

---

# Installation

```bash
npm install react-router-dom@6.10.0
```

---

# Core Components

In v6.10.0 we'll use these constantly:

```jsx
BrowserRouter
Routes
Route
Link
NavLink
Navigate
Outlet
useNavigate
useParams
useLocation
useSearchParams
```

---

# BrowserRouter

The root router.

Usually in:

```jsx
main.jsx
```

or

```jsx
index.js
```

Example:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root")
).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

---

What BrowserRouter does:

It listens for URL changes.

Example:

```text
localhost:3000/
localhost:3000/login
localhost:3000/cart
```

and tells React which component should render.

---

# Routes

Routes is a container for Route components.

```jsx
<Routes>
</Routes>
```

Think:

```text
Route registry
```

or

```text
List of possible pages
```

---

# Route

Defines which component should render for a path.

Example:

```jsx
<Routes>

  <Route
    path="/"
    element={<HomeScreen />}
  />

  <Route
    path="/login"
    element={<LoginScreen />}
  />

</Routes>
```

---

Meaning:

```text
/       -> HomeScreen
/login  -> LoginScreen
```

---

# element Prop

Old v5:

```jsx
<Route component={HomeScreen}/>
```

v6:

```jsx
<Route element={<HomeScreen />} />
```

Notice:

```jsx
<HomeScreen />
```

is an actual JSX element.

---

# Route Matching

Example:

```jsx
<Route
 path="/about"
 element={<AboutPage />}
/>
```

URL:

```text
/about
```

renders:

```jsx
<AboutPage />
```

---

Any other URL:

```text
/contact
```

won't match.

---

# Nested Routes

One of the biggest improvements in v6.

Example:

```jsx
<Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>

  <Route
    index
    element={<Home />}
  />

  <Route
    path="products"
    element={<Products />}
  />

</Route>
```

---

Structure:

```text
Layout
 ├─ Home
 └─ Products
```

---

Layout remains visible while children change.

Common for:

```text
Navbar
Footer
Sidebar
```

---

# Outlet

Outlet renders child routes.

Example:

```jsx
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

function Layout() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />

      <Outlet />

      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

---

Without Outlet:

Child routes never appear.

Think:

```text
Outlet = placeholder
```

for nested pages.

---

# Link

Never use:

```jsx
<a href="/login">
```

inside React Router apps.

Why?

Because it reloads the page.

---

Use:

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

<Link to="/login">
  Login
</Link>
```

---

Generated HTML:

```html
<a href="/login">
```

But React intercepts the click and performs client-side navigation.

No page refresh.

---

# NavLink

Special version of Link.

Automatically knows whether it is active.

Example:

```jsx
<NavLink to="/login">
  Login
</NavLink>
```

---

Useful for navigation bars.

Example:

```text
Home
Products
Cart
```

Current page gets active styling.

---

# Dynamic Routes

Very important in e-commerce.

Example:

```jsx
<Route
 path="/product/:id"
 element={<ProductScreen />}
/>
```

---

Meaning:

```text
/product/1
/product/2
/product/999
```

all use the same component.

---

# useParams

Reads route parameters.

Example URL:

```text
/product/123
```

Route:

```jsx
<Route
 path="/product/:id"
 element={<ProductScreen />}
/>
```

Inside ProductScreen:

```jsx
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function ProductScreen() {
  const params = useParams();

  console.log(params);
}
```

Result:

```js
{
  id: "123"
}
```

---

Destructuring:

```jsx
const { id } = useParams();
```

Now:

```jsx
console.log(id);
```

outputs:

```text
123
```

---

This is heavily used in MERN projects:

```jsx
fetch(`/api/products/${id}`)
```

---

# useNavigate

Programmatic navigation.

Equivalent to:

```text
redirect user
```

---

Example:

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function Login() {

 const navigate = useNavigate();

 const submitHandler = () => {
   navigate("/");
 };

}
```

---

After login:

```text
/login
```

becomes:

```text
/
```

without reload.

---

Navigate to product:

```jsx
navigate(`/product/${id}`);
```

---

Go back:

```jsx
navigate(-1);
```

Same as browser Back button.

---

Go forward:

```jsx
navigate(1);
```

---

Replace history:

```jsx
navigate("/", {
 replace: true
});
```

Useful after login.

Prevents:

```text
Back -> Login page
```

---

# Navigate Component

Declarative redirect.

Example:

```jsx
import { Navigate } from "react-router-dom";

if (!userInfo) {
  return <Navigate to="/login" />;
}
```

---

Meaning:

```text
Not logged in?
Go to login page.
```

Common in protected routes.

---

# useLocation

Returns current URL information.

Example:

```jsx
const location = useLocation();
```

---

Current URL:

```text
/cart?qty=2
```

returns:

```js
{
 pathname: "/cart",
 search: "?qty=2"
}
```

---

Useful for:

* analytics
* redirects
* breadcrumbs

---

# Query Parameters

URL:

```text
/search?keyword=iphone
```

Query string:

```text
keyword=iphone
```

---

# useSearchParams

Reads query parameters.

Example:

```jsx
const [searchParams] =
 useSearchParams();
```

---

Read:

```jsx
searchParams.get("keyword");
```

returns:

```text
iphone
```

---

URL:

```text
?page=3
```

returns:

```jsx
searchParams.get("page")
```

↓

```text
3
```

---

Used heavily for:

* pagination
* search
* filtering

---

# Index Routes

Instead of:

```jsx
<Route
 path=""
 element={<Home />}
/>
```

v6 prefers:

```jsx
<Route
 index
 element={<Home />}
/>
```

Meaning:

Default child route.

---

# Wildcard Routes

Catch unknown URLs.

```jsx
<Route
 path="*"
 element={<NotFound />}
/>
```

Example:

```text
/random-page
```

renders:

```jsx
<NotFound />
```

---

# Route Ranking

v6 automatically chooses the most specific route.

Example:

```jsx
<Route path="/product/new" />
<Route path="/product/:id" />
```

URL:

```text
/product/new
```

Correctly matches:

```text
/product/new
```

instead of:

```text
id = new
```

No manual ordering needed.

---

# Typical MERN E-commerce Routing

```jsx
<Routes>

<Route
 path="/"
 element={<HomeScreen />}
/>

<Route
 path="/product/:id"
 element={<ProductScreen />}
/>

<Route
 path="/cart"
 element={<CartScreen />}
/>

<Route
 path="/login"
 element={<LoginScreen />}
/>

<Route
 path="/register"
 element={<RegisterScreen />}
/>

<Route
 path="*"
 element={<NotFound />}
/>

</Routes>
```

---

# Navigation Flow

Example:

Home:

```text
/
```

↓

Click Product Card

```text
/product/123
```

↓

Add to Cart

```text
/cart
```

↓

Login

```text
/login
```

↓

Checkout

```text
/shipping
```

All without reloading the page.

That's the main power of React Router.

# Most Important Things to Master First

For our MERN e-commerce project, we'll focus on these in order:

1. `BrowserRouter`
2. `Routes`
3. `Route`
4. `Link`
5. `useParams`
6. `useNavigate`
7. `Navigate`
8. `useLocation`
9. `useSearchParams`
10. `Outlet`

Once these ten concepts are comfortable, we'll understand almost everything commonly used from **react-router-dom v6.10.0** in real-world MERN applications.
